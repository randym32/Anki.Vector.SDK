# Anki Vector .NET SDK

The Vector SDK gives you direct access to [Anki Vector](https://www.anki.com/en-us/vector)'s unprecedented set of advanced sensors, AI capabilities, and robotics technologies including computer vision, intelligent mapping and navigation, and a groundbreaking collection of expressive animations.

### About this SDK

This SDK gives full access to all of Vector's hardware and software features available from Vector's firmware.  This even includes features currently not available from of the official [Python SDK](https://github.com/anki/vector-python-sdk) including face enrollment, adjusting Vector's permanent settings, and new features in firmware 1.7.  The API design follows the design of the Python SDK but deviates in a few places for simplicity or consistency with the underlying gRPC API.
